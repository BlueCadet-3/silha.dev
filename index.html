            Football Head was the final project of General Assembly's Software
            Engineering Immersive program. It is a MERN-Stack single-page
            application with JWT Token user authorization. It also leverages a
            third-party API from ESPN Fantasy Football. This project actually
            started as an Excel spreadsheet many years ago and can be seen as
            part of my motivation to learn programming. The potential for
            continual improvement is boundless. The idea is that it will make an
            API call based on every season your fantasy football league has
            played, add that data to your user model, and have it accessed later
            when it is compiled and rendered through visualizations and such.
            The only problem is, at the moment, I can only make a single API
            request to ESPN without getting subsequent requests denied.
            Unfortunately their only documentation is from two API versions and
            six years ago so I've really gotta get in there and pick it apart,
            which I've never really done before. I haven't figured it out yet,
            but I will...

            Doctor Express was the project required after the second unit of the
            program. The requirements were to create an application using the
            MEN-Stack with full CRUD capability. My app centered around the idea
            of a portal for doctor-to-patient and patient-to-doctor
            communications after a couple of situations involving information
            moving too quickly and also too slowly. The user can create, read,
            update, and delete all notes and medications attached to their user
            profile. This app also implements Google OAuth authentication as the
            sole sign-in option.

            Splash Music was the third project completed during GA's Software
            Engineering Immersive program. It was the one and only group
            project, and also the one and only Python and Django project. Using
            another object-oriented language with a different syntax really
            helped solidify the use of objects in my mind. The group utilized a
            mob programming approach over Zoom. We would have one driver with
            the rest navigating in order to avoid any problems with merge
            conflicts whatsoever. A few roles were handed out in the beginning
            of the project, in which I was GitHub manager, meaning I got to
            handle merging pull requests and kept everybody in sync along the
            way. Overall, the project went well and we maintained a good
            chemistry along the way.

            This was the very first project in the program! We got to select
            from a list of games and I selected the card game War. The point of
            the project was to use JavaScript for it's dynamic and logical
            nature for the first time. The game is user vs CPU, where the user
            can click their card to battle with the CPU. The player with the
            higher card wins and takes the cards! If the cards are equal in
            value, it results in a war! Two more cards are layed down and the
            second card drawn determine the next battle! If those cards are the
            same...it will lead to more war! The winner then collects all the
            cards involved. It even comes with some fun sounds!
