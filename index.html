        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello there! I am a software developer from Chicago, Illinois. My experience began in a long time ago in high school managing a website for a club I was in for three years. It was mostly modification of a template in both HTML and CSS and dancing all around cPanel. I didn't realize how much being familiar with many coding concepts would help me when I finally decided to formalize my skills while completing General Assembly's 420-Hour Software Engineering Immersive program! I got a very deep dive into JavaScript which was my biggest blind spot in web development. I hope to contribute to your business with efficient and purposeful code!

            This has been where the majority of my time since graduating my bootcamp has been spent.  ER Air is my first client as a freelance software engineer!  Their primary focus is on SEO and digital marketing.  They came to me with a WordPress site already established, but with their strong focus on SEO I decided the best course of action was to get off of WordPress.  Why?  In anticipaion of Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience">Core Web Vitals update</a> currently being rolled out, the site basically had no chance competing with a site built directly in HTML/CSS/JS.  The site was approaching one million lines of code with so many unnecessary scripts, stylesheets and divs within divs within divs...which was simply just overkill for a small static website. What made it even worse was there wasn't a single drop of metadata amongst these nearly million lines of code, which is quite necessary for basic SEO.  Lighthouse overall scores preceding the takeover were running around 23 and 45 on mobile and desktop.  It is now scoring between 95-100 for mobile and desktop.  There are many improvements to come but I also can't wait to see how these changes affect their search ranking over the next few months!

            Football Head was the final project of General Assembly's Software
            Engineering Immersive program. It is a MERN-Stack single-page
            application using JWT Token user authorization. It also leverages a
            third-party API from ESPN Fantasy Football. This project actually
            started as an Excel spreadsheet many years ago and can be seen as
            part of my motivation to learn programming as I was getting tired of
            entering the data manually and wanted a solution. The potential for
            continual improvement to this application is boundless in my eyes.
            How it works is that it will make an API call based on every season
            your fantasy football league has played, add the data from another
            API call for each season and have it accessed later when it is
            compiled and rendered through visualizations and such. As of now I
            have got some basic visualizations using Recharts going and will be
            expanding to more interesting data points and conclusions in the
            near future. Test credentials and more technical documentation can
            be found on each respective GitHub repository.

            Doctor Express was the project required after the second unit of the
            program. The requirements were to create an application using the
            MEN-Stack with full CRUD capability. My app centered around the idea
            of a portal for doctor-to-patient and patient-to-doctor
            communications after a couple of situations involving information
            moving too quickly and also too slowly. The user can create, read,
            update, and delete all notes and medications attached to their user
            profile. This app also implements Google OAuth authentication as the
            sole sign-in option.

            Splash Music was the third project completed during GA's Software
            Engineering Immersive program. It was the one and only group
            project, and also the one and only Python and Django project. Using
            another object-oriented language with a different syntax really
            helped solidify the use of objects in my mind. The group utilized a
            mob programming approach over Zoom. We would have one driver with
            the rest navigating in order to avoid any problems with merge
            conflicts whatsoever. A few roles were handed out in the beginning
            of the project, in which I was GitHub manager, meaning I got to
            handle merging pull requests and kept everybody in sync along the
            way. Overall, the project went well, fulfilled all the requirements
            and we maintained a great chemistry along the way.

            This was the very first project in the program! We got to select
            from a list of games and I selected the card game War. The point of
            the project was to use JavaScript for it's dynamic and logical
            nature for the first time. The game is user vs CPU, where the user
            can click their card to battle with the CPU. The player with the
            higher card wins and takes the cards! If the cards are equal in
            value, it results in a war! Two more cards are layed down and the
            second card drawn determine the next battle! If those cards are the
            same...it will lead to more war! The winner then collects all the
            cards involved. It even comes with some fun sounds!
